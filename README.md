# CLIP

CLIP (Compact and Lightweight Immutable Packaging) is a new transparent file format, similar to tar, but designed for efficient storage of read-only data. The primary feature of CLIP is its transparency, enabling direct access to its content without extraction, even over remote storage. CLIP can be mounted as a FUSE filesystem, or can be extracted like a tar file.

## Features

- **Efficiency**: The CLIP file format reduces storage costs by utilizing space more effectively. It is designed to store large amounts of read-only data efficiently.
- **Transparency**: CLIP files are transparent, which means you do not need to extract them to access their content, even over remote storage.
- **Mountable**: You can mount a CLIP file and access its content directly using a FUSE filesystem.
- **Extractable**: CLIP files can be extracted just like tar files, offering you flexibility in data access.
- **Remote-First**: CLIP is designed with remote storage in mind. It works seamlessly with various cloud storage services and can be easily integrated into existing remote storage workflows.

## Getting Started
